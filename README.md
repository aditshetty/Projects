# Projects 

This is a repository containing projects I've worked on at School. These projects are related to my courses, which is why I cannot share raw data for these analyses at the moment. 
Since I am the only user of this repo, I simply edit files in the main branch as opposed to creating branches and maintaining different versions. 

# Repository Structure

There are two kinds of projects in this repo, which dictate its structure:

## Long Form Projects

These are major projects related to my courses, and have a dedicated folder for each of them. They took several hours of work and involved a 2-3 page report. 

## Short Form Projects

These are projects related to my Marketing Analytics Course. These short analyses were done in a span of 30 minutes during class time, and they were graded. The code was set up before class, which meant that most of the work during the 30-minute window involved debugging and analyzing. The analysis was generally addressed to a stakeholder of a business, which is why these projects are contain very high level analysis.
